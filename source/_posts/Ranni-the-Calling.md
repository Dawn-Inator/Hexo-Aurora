:::tip In the distant mists of time:
*The fallen leaves tell a story,
The great Anor Lord was shattered.In our region, across the fog, the Lands Genisar.
A war from which no lord arose.
A war leading to destruction by the Greater Will.
Oh, arise now, ye ***Lost one***.
Ye dead, who yet live.
The call of long-lost grace speaks to us all.*

***Seek out the call of the distant beyond.***

## The End

*The Fallen leaves bring a message: at the end of the mist, a voice calls out.*

..The battle is over, I see.

I do solemnly swear.

To every living being, and every living soul.

Now cometh the age of the stars.

A thousand year voyage under the wisdom of the Moon.

Here beginneth the chill night that encompasses all, reaching the great beyond.

Into fear, doubt, and loneliness...

As the path stretcheth into darkness...

Let us go,together.
